This project uses yarn for package management, not NPM.

When suggesting commands or making changes that involve package management:
1. Use yarn commands (e.g., `yarn add`, `yarn remove`) instead of npm commands
2. For running scripts, use `yarn [script]` instead of `npm run [script]`
3. For workspaces, use `yarn wospace [name] [command]` instead of `npm run [command] -w [name]`
